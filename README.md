Screen Recorder using Python
Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a screen recorder using Python. The script captures your screen's content and saves it as a video file. The implementation relies on the following Python modules:

NumPy

Install NumPy using the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
PyAutoGUI

Install PyAutoGUI for mouse and keyboard control:
bash
Copy code
pip install pyautogui
OpenCV (cv2)

Install OpenCV for computer vision and image processing:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
Usage
PyAutoGUI:

PyAutoGUI is a library that enables you to control the mouse and keyboard to automate tasks or capture screenshots. It's commonly used for GUI automation, allowing the creation of scripts that simulate human interaction with the computer.
OpenCV (cv2):

OpenCV is the Open Source Computer Vision library for Python. Widely used in computer vision and image processing tasks, OpenCV provides functions to manipulate and analyze images, along with tools for working with computer vision algorithms.
NumPy:

NumPy is a powerful library for numerical operations in Python. It supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions for efficient operations on these elements.
Installation
To install the required modules, use the following commands:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
pip install pyautogui
pip install opencv-python
Save to grepper
